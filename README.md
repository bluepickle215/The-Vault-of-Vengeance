# The-Vault-of-Vengeance
If you're a ranged or magic player, ranged especially you want this mod  Adds a wide variety of awesome weapons, from simple laser-guns to nuclear warhead launchers.  Reccomend to use a recipie browser, I tried my best to make most of the recipies simple,  Most stuff are made of 'alloys' that vary depending on how far you are in the game  Almost every weapon is crafted, so don't bother grinding NPCs  Questions, comments, concerns or cool suggestions? Please email me bluepickle215@gmail.com If you send a suggestion/idea, nothing boring please. I don't want to get an email about making a gun that shoots bullets.      I'm bluepickle, just a guy on the internet that makes terraria stuff as a hobby. I've made several different mods, many that aren't published. A while ago, i published a few mods. (Sorcerer's eceret,Picklemania); and they got more attention than expected. These were not well-crafted, and i wasn't very proud of them. However, after a long hiatus of not publishing anything, I decided to make a come back and create this.
